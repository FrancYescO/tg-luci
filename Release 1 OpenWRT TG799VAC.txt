Step 1) Run Autoflash GUI by Mark Smith. Run this tool to obtain root access.
Step 2) Download WinSCP, set to SCP and connect to the router
Step 3) Download technicolor-tg799vac-hacks-master (for complete gutting), or 06-Debloat-initd.sh (Modified version of former by me), unzip to subfolder containing AutoflashGUI
Step 4) Download libraries provided by me (Github or Owncloud links provided) & unzip. Using WinSCP, transfer these across, along with the script files contained inside step 2 to the /root directory
Step 5) Using vi, edit the scripts as per your liking, paying close attention to the sections that are hashed out, these are areas that **NEED** to be edited & will be hashed out with ##. 
		Save & exit, then run the following command: chmod +x *.sh 
		What this will do is allow the script/s to be executed.
Step 6) Before proceeding with the first reboot, please take this moment to **DOUBLE CHECK** the relevant sections you've just modified to suit your network. Otherwise you'll be locked out
Step 7) Run the script/s (Depending which ones you choose). If it's mine, it will reboot automatically. If the other scripts, you'll need to reboot before proceeding.

NOTE: PLEASE ENSURE TO DO THE STEPS AS REQUESTED. DON'T ASK FOR HELP OTHERWISE. IT'S DONE THIS WAY FOR A REASON*

Step 8) Using vi, edit the following file: /etc/opkg.conf & check to see if the following lines have been successfully installed. If not, edit the file and add them before proceeding.
		arch all 100
		arch brcm63xx 200
		arch brcm63xx-tch 300
Step 9) Run opkg update. This is crucial for the next step, so **DON'T MISS IT**
Step 10) Now here's where the fun begins. Run the following command: opkg --force-reinstall --force-overwrite --force-checksum install *.ipk
		 This command will then forcibly install the required libraries to continue with the next step
Step 11) Run uci commit & reboot the router. This will allow a clean slate to continue. Proceed with the next step/s
Step 12) Use the following command to get luci installed: opkg install luci luci-lib-json luci-lib-jsonc luci-lib-nixio luci-mod-rpc <---- These extra libraries are *CRITICAL*
Step 13) Run uci commit. Then reboot.
Step 14) Once it reboots, browse to the routers designated IP. Login as per usual (root/root)
Step 15) Change the root password.
Step 16) Thank me :) & enjoy Release 1 OpenWRT TG789/799. You get base functionality + Wireless. There will be minor reporting glitching on the wireless, but that will get fixed in time.
		**DON'T INSTALL EXTRA MODULES YET**. There are a few known modules which cause the router to segfault. As we get more time to experiment/add, the list will be expanded, but if you leave it as 
		it is, it will *just work*
Step 17) Ensure to run a configuration backup through Luci. Then keep it safe, so if in future you need to reinstall, its a quick restore.
Step 18) Pray for an unlocked bootloader
